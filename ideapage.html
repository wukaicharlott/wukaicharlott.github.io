    <div class="desc">The key idea of this project is to improve the function in Paddington area in Sydney. By observation, the pedestrian system in this area is inconvenient, especially at Flemings Lane and Albion Avenue. There has no signal to indicate pedestrian. For Flemings Lane, there is no crossway for people to go opposite the street, and the Albion Avenue is blocked by the concrete wall, therefore people couldn't get passed only when they tried to go opposite at Flinders street. The road designed in that area brings difficulties for people who are not familiar the place.
       <br>
        By improvement, a larger shopping center is designed to connect three parts of the roads and acts like ‘bridge'. One example to inspire the design process is the Paris-based LEA Invent in Faith Vantan Street, Istanbul, Turkey. The footbridge associates the main axe and the historic peninsula together without interrupting current road system (Jordana, S,2011).  Different with the design in Turkey, the reinvent walkway bridge is designed more functional. It will play the role of a huge shopping center to decrease the intensity in the city area, Moreover, around that area is Moore park which provides enough space for vegetation area. Also, the residence area, campus of UNSW Art and Design, the Allianz Stadium provides necessity of purchasing.

    <div class="desc">The three spiral building acts as the foundation of the ‘bridge' and connected by metal pipes. The façade of the building is made of glass fibre located at three sperate area. The beneficial of three separate building is it can act as a footbridge as well as shopping center. It generates the linkage more functional.  The building can also act as a new commercial center to decrease the intensity pressure in central Sydney and provides this area a chance to develop. </div>
